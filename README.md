Apache DynIP
============

Allows updating of the Apache "Allow from x.x.x.x " configuration with a dynamic IP periodically.

Usage:      dynip.py domain config
Example:    dynip.py home.dyndns.org /etc/httpd/conf.d/vhost.conf

### TODO

* Further validation checks
* Restart apache once changes have been made
